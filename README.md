This is a memory game built with React and has components for the header, card, page wrapper, and footer. 

## Play and score points

The object of the game is to click as many cards as you can without duplicating them. Each time you click, the cards will shuffle into a new position.

The current score is the most clicked this round, and resets to 0 when duplicating clicks. The top score is the most cards since you started paying.
